			This website has three main topics:
		</p>
		
			<ul> <!-- Start of List --> 
				<li><a href="informal.html">Informal Instructions</a></li>
				<li><a href="algorithms.html">Algorithms</a></li>
				<li><a href="programs.html">Programs</a></li>
			</ul> <!-- end of list -->

			We will use the topic of 'prime numbers' to explain each concept and show how they are related.  Below are some general definitions / explanations.

			Informal instructions are written in natural languages (eg: French, Zulu, English, Te Reo, Sanscrit).  Computers can't understand informal instructions like 'make a cup of tea, no milk, two sugars'.  Humans can of course easily follow informal instructions provided there is sufficient detail.  Take a look at the <a href="informal.html">Informal Instructions</a> page for an example of using informal instructions to find prime numbers.<br />

			An <a href="algorithms.html">Algorithm</a> is a precise sequence of steps which explains, in detail how to do a task.  A good example of a tea making algorithm is below:
		</p>
		
		 <ol> <!-- Start of ordered list -->
			<li>Boil Water</li>
			<li>Get cup and saucer from cupboard</li>
			<li>Put cup on top of saucer</li>
			<li>Put one tea bag into the cup</li>
			<li>Pour 200 mL of boiling water into the cup</li>
			<li>Let the tea steep for 5 minutes</li>
			<li>Remove the tea bag and throw it away</li>
			<li>Add two teaspoons of sugar and stir gently until the sugar is dissolved.</li>
		</ol> <!-- end list -->
		
		<p>
			Whilst the instructions above are clear and *hopefully* easy to follow, a robot would not be able to make a cup of tea by following the instructions above.  Algorithms can be documented using a flow chart.

			A <a href="programs.html">Program</a> is a series of instructions written in a programming language which would tell a robot exactly what to do to make a cup of tea.  Programs usually contain more than one algorithm.  They also have structures for repeating actions (looping) and making decisions (if / then statments).  Needless to say, programming a robot to make a cup of tea would be quite a complicated endeavour.
