    Why Reading is so important.

Reading Is a skill taught to us from an early age, when we first start school at the age of 5,
Skills necessary to learning to read at a high level are already being taught to us.
These basic skills such as The alphabet, pronunciation and a basic vocabulary are crucial to
Our later life, where if you lack the skill of reading, you are going to have a hard time finding
A job, never mind a good pay one.

Reading is a very important skill, and great fun to get lost in during spare time, but sadly its
Becoming obsolete with the inventions of T.V, Gaming consoles and computers.
In America, less than 50% of university students read a book in their spare time, and in turn
The Reading scores for adults across the world has deteriorated.

Reading is an important skill, and each person should be reading at least half an hour a day, 
whether is a magazine, short story, articles, or a novel does not matter, as long as your reading as
The benefits for it are remarkable. Signs of Memory improvement, improved focus and concentration
And even Stronger analytical skills. Other Benefits such as our vocabulary and the fact it improves
Your writing skills are extremely important swell.

Aside from filling your head with knowledge, delaying altimeters and Improving your focus, reading
Releases stress, which we can all make use of time to time. There is nothing more calming than 
sitting down, and reading a book, getting lost in the virtual world of a fictional novel, or
Cramming your brain full of information in a nonfiction book, Either one is a great way to release
Stresses that've built their way into your brain.

Overall, I think reading should be more focused upon in later years of primary school, and more
Effort put into correcting Teenage years reading, things such as reading programs that Help
Bring under the Standard readers to a higher level and a larger focus on bringing reading into 
their spare time. Reading greatly improves all our life's, its a way to commute feelings, 
Share ideas and last of all, spread knowledge.

Later in our schooling, reading no longer becomes as important, and the children that have trouble
Reading struggle in all their subjects, lose access to a leisure activity, and most of all are
Disadvantaged in their later life.
